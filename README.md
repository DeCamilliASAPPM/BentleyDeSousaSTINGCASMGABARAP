This is a Python script for identifying LIR motifs in LRRK2 that conform to the W/F/Y-x-x-I/L/V consensus. It provides a list of such motifs along with their respective locations in the LRRK2 protein. The LRRK2 sequence can be replaced with other proteins to predict the presence of this motif in them.
